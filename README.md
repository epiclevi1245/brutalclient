# brutalclient
client for http://brutal.io for modding and hosting modded servers for others with the client
## Files
all files can be found in brutal/
inside there are 3 folders, clients, code, and packets
inside the clients folder you can see the current version of the brutal client
inside the code folder is prettified brutal.io code and painstakingly written documentation
inside the packets folder you can find packet loggers, clientbound packets, and serverbound packets

I currently know the most about serverbound packets and am in the proccess of parsing clientbound packets
The packet loggers anyone can use on any game to see what websocket data is being sent back and forward

## Progress
brutalclient is still in very early development and we have not parsed all of the packets.
after we have working packet parsers, I will upload a rudementary indev client controled by acommand prompt.
all packets and their parsers will be avaliable to anyone that wants them to learn about making a game or wants to make a mod for the client.
