#### Features
* Entire Client -> Server protocol (movement, clicks, nick, ....)
* Party support

* Support of deaths and kills
#### TODO

## Example
```js
// Using party (has player limit)
let bot = new Brutal({
    party: "1wlc",
    nick: `dimden's bot`,
    autoplay: true
});
// Using raw server address
let bot = new Brutal({
    address: "164.132.205.24:8080",
    nick: `dimden's bot`,
    autoplay: true
});
```

## Options
* `party` - invite to the server (Note: this has ~70 user limit)
* `nick` - nick of the bot
* `autoplay` - play again on death
* `country` - your country code (default `UA`)
* `address` - raw address of server, no need for `party` option

## Events
* `server` - found server address using party invite. `{room, party, address}`
* `close` - disconnected from server (will automatically reconnect).
* `open` - connected to server (__it doesn't mean you're in game yet, use `this.playing`__)

* `id` - got your id in game
* `king` - updated king info (doesn't work yet)

### World

# Warning
**There's a lot of stuff, but you actually don't need anything from `this.world`, `this.utils`, you only need movement and click methods,
leaderboard, id, rank, minimap, death & kills. Client connects to server and joins the server automatically, and if there's `autoplay` option, it'll play again on death!**
